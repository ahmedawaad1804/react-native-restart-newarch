Ever wished your React Native app could **restart itself like a phoenix rising from the ashes**? 🔥 **Now it can!**

---

## 📱 Supported Minimum Versions

- **iOS**: 12.0
- **Android**: 21 (Lollipop)

No more manually killing the app. Just call `RNRestart.restart()` and let the magic happen! 🪄✨

---

## 🛠️ Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-restart-newarch
```

(Yeah, it's that easy!)

---

## 🚀 Usage

```js
import RNRestart from "react-native-restart-newarch"; // Import package from node modules

// Immediately reload the React Native Bundle

RNRestart.restart(); // BOOM! Your app restarts instantly! ⚡
// Or
RNRestart.Restart(); // BOOM! Your app restarts instantly! ⚡
```

This is **faster than a full reload** and **easier than debugging a state issue**.

---

## 🧐 Why Use This?

✅ **Supports the New Architecture** (TurboModules FTW!)
✅ **Supports the Old Architecture** (Backward Compatible)
✅ **No Native Code Tweaks Needed** (Plug & Play)
✅ **Instant Restart** (Goodbye, manual reloading)
✅ **Perfect for Feature Toggles** (Change configs & restart on the fly!)
